-- MSG_NOSIGNAL is undefined on Solaris, so module is unusable.
   instead, should let callers choose to handle it themselves
   ($SIG{'PIPE'} = "IGNORE";) or otherwise let the module do it
   itself, in which case it'll do MSG_NOSIGNAL if available,
   or localize $SIG{'PIPE'} everywhere, which is kinda slow.
   (lot of syscalls)

-- provide option to not do remapping, to avoid the "netsplit
   problem".  (some apps might have a problem with that)
